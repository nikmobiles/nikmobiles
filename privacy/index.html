            </p>

            <h4>Visiting our Website</h4>
            <p>
                As soon as you visit our website, the company we have entrusted with the website’s operation will store
                the public IP address of the computer you are using to visit our website. This includes the access date
                and time. The IP address is a unique numeric address, through which your computer sends and receives data
                via the internet. Usually, neither we nor our service provider will know whom the IP address belongs to,
                unless you provide us with any data permitting us to identify you while using our website. Also, a user can be
                identified if we take legal action (in cases of cyber-attacks on our website, for instance) and are
                informed of the user’s identity during the process of investigation. So as a general rule, you will not have to
                worry we will be able to draw a connection between you and your IP address.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our service provider is using the IP address to enable you to visit and use our website, and to discover
                and prevent attacks on our websites. Unfortunately, websites are attacked frequently, in order to harm the
                operators and users (for example blocking the access, spying on data, distributing malware like viruses
                or other illegal purposes). Such attacks would adversely affect our website’s intended use as well as the
                security of our website’s visitors. The IP address, along with the visit’s time, is being processed to
                prevent such attacks and potential dangers resulting from them for ourselves and for our website’s
                users. Via our service provider we are pursuing the justified interests of maintaining our business operations
                as well as of preventing unlawful interference affecting ourselves or our website’s visitors. The legal
                basis of this processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR). The stored IP data will be deleted by de-personalization, provided they are no longer necessary for the
                purpose of identifying or preventing attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are using DDoS Mitigation to route traffic and scale attacks. Our service partner is Akamai which
                uses 20 global scrubbing centers around the world. Normally the traffic is routed within your country but for
                high availability it could be a cross border transfer. Akamai is certificated and committed to compliance
                with the laws in America, Europe and Asia and runs a data protection and privacy program to protect your
                personal data. Visit Akamai´s Privacy Trust Center for more information at <a
                        href="https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.akamai.com/us/en/about/compliance/</a>.

            <h4>Ways of Contact</h4>
            <p>
                Whenever you contact us via one of the ways of contact provided, we will make use of the data provided
                by you to process your inquiry. The legal basis for this is our justified interest in replying to your
                request according to article 6 paragraph 1 f of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If your request
                is serving the purpose of concluding or processing a contract with us, the additional basis of the
                processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 b of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data will be
                deleted after your request has been completed. In cases in which we are obligated by law to store the
                data for a longer period, they will be deleted after the expiry of this period.
            </p>

            <h4>Creating a Customer Account</h4>
            <p>
                You are using our service to have erotic adventures and contact other users. To use all of our offer’s
                functionalities, you need to create a customer account. Apart from the information required during the
                registration process, all other personal information will be provided voluntarily. You alone decide what
                information you would like to include in your user profile. You can edit or delete your data at any
                time. The more information you provide, the higher are the chances for other users to find you and recognize
                mutual interests you share with them. As our website is accessible for everyone via the internet, all
                the information provided by you will be public. There are additional processes to identify and protect
                children – if we learn that the data is from children and collected without authorization it will be deleted as
                soon as possible. Otherwise contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not provide any data permitting us to identify you (such as your mobile number), you can use
                our service without us knowing who you are. If you buy coins, you will have to provide your name and your
                address, but only our payment service provider will receive this data, which they will not forward to
                us. Accordingly, you will be able to use our service anonymously.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you create a customer account and add information to your profile, we are processing the data
                provided by you for this purpose, to create and administrate your customer account, as well as to enable
                you to make use of the services related to your customer account. Additionally, the data will be used for
                our service and made accessible to other users, in accordance with their intended purpose (for example
                searching for specific inclinations and interests, match checks to identify mutual interests and preferences).
                The legal basis of this processing activity is article 6 paragraph 1 b) of the General Data Protection
                Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
                During the process of creating a user account, we will be able to identify your approximate location,
                based on your IP address. We will use this to pre-enter this location in your user profile, which you can
                change. This is done to ensure that the members of our service will use the correct location for local searches
                and thereby – unless they adapt the location – will find other members. The legal basis of this processing
                activity is article 6 paragraph 1 f) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
                The data will be stored until the customer account is deleted. In cases in which we are obligated by law
                to store the data beyond this event (to fulfill accounting obligations, for instance), or if we are legally
                entitled to store the data beyond this event (in case of a current lawsuit against the user account
                owner, for instance), the data will be deleted as soon as the obligation or the legal authorization to store
                the data ceases to exist.
            </p>

            <h4>Signup via Google and Facebook</h4>

                If you add any data to your profile, or otherwise communicate any data to us for processing, which could
                be considered to be data of special categories within the meaning of article 9 of the General Data
                Protection Regulation (GDPR) (for example ethnic origin, religious or ideological conviction, data referring to

                use them for no other purpose than providing the functionalities of our service, for which these data will
                be accessed and used. This involves the public indication of these data in relation to your customer

            <p>

                If you purchase coins, we will process the data provided by you to conclude and process the contract. To
                the necessary extent, data will be transferred to service providers to invoice your purchase, or the data

                Data stored in connection with the conclusion of a contract concerning the purchase of a product will be
                deleted on expiration of the legal retention obligation. In cases in which legal record keeping
                requirements and retention obligations exist (for example retention of invoices according to tax legislation), the
                legal basis for this processing activity is article 1 paragraph 1 c) of the General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR). We will delete or de-personalize the data as soon as they are no longer necessary for the
